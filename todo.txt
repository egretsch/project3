Stuff left to do:


Get Scanner to work with Product Search
--This means:
    - Save the scanned product code into a database WITH the brand name of product
        (this is so if the product is scanned again, there won't be a need to input the name again)
    - Getting the information from the database and putting it in the product search.


    --Scanner User Flow
        --Search Page - Button is tapped to start scanner

                Scanner scans an item for its UPC Code -
                   - Code is checked inside the database
                        -Scanner scans an item that is NOT in the database.
                            -Modal pops up saying product not found AND IT SHOWS THE UPC Code that is scanned
                            (ctrl + f,  Scanner Start to find it, please test this out).
                            
                            - IF cancel is hit - modal closes, search stops (Needs test, I think it's done).
                            
                            - user inputs BRAND NAME of item and hits submit button.
                            
                            - brand name of item + upc code goes into database (needs to be done).
                            
                            - brand name is SEARCHED in the product search (needs to be done).
                            - search results popped up. (SHOULD ONLY BRING UP THE PRODUCT ITSELF. 
                              I limited the website API call to 1, so the search needs to be EXACT)
                            
                            -if product is not found in API, return modal (no search results found)

                        -Scanner scans an item that IS INSIDE THE DATABASE
                            - Modal pops up (CAN BE OPTIONAL) saying product is found
                            - Product results are then shown. (SHOULD ONLY BRING UP THE PRODUCT ITSELF)
                            - if product is not found in API return modal (no search results found)
