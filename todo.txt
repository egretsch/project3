Stuff left to do:

Get exact matches out of API
    -play around with the brand_name: query. Refine the search.
    -White spaces are filled with %20, but it only works with two words?
    
Get it Deployed
    -If any Heroku problems, then we will fix ASAP.

Login Page merged with the rest of the App
    -Check if any bugs logging in or out.
    -Check if all buttons work when logged in. (in the navbar)
    -Check if information is pulled from database.
    
Error Modals?
    --Just in case something goes wrong, the user can at least know something went wrong. (Search.js completed)
    -- Creating a user - error on trying to make an account with used email/username
    -- Error on login - Error trying to login (wrong username or password)
    -- Profile - Error on updating information and deleting saved data (such as if it fails)

    
Let users update their information
--This means:
    - Changing their name, email, and password.




Make it pretty
    --Any loading animations
    --Any thematic things we want to products
    --Specific font styles?
    --Is it mobile friendly? (The Scanner Modal needs some work)
    --Need an about page? Footer? etc.
