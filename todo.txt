Stuff left to do:


Get Scanner to work with Product Search
--This means:
    - Save the scanned product code into a database WITH the brand name of product
        (this is so if the product is scanned again, there won't be a need to input the name again)
    - Getting the information from the database and putting it in the product search.


    --Scanner User Story
        --Search Page - Button is tapped to start scanner

                Scanner scans an item for its UPC Code -
                   - Code is checked inside the database
                        -Scanner scans an item that is NOT in the database.
                            -Modal pops up saying product not found, user has to put in the BRAND NAME  (tell them it's required).
                                - cancel - modal closes, search stops.
                            - user inputs BRAND NAME of item.
                            - brand name of item + upc code goes into database.
                            - brand name is SEARCHED in the product search.
                            - search results popped up. (SHOULD ONLY BRING UP THE PRODUCT ITSELF. We'll need to specifically input the brand name we want.
                                                        Perhaps making something specific inside our database model?)
                            -if product is not found in API, return modal (no search results found)
                            
                        -Scanner scans an item that IS INSIDE THE DATABASE
                            - Modal pops up (CAN BE OPTIONAL) saying product is found
                            - Product results are then shown. (SHOULD ONLY BRING UP THE PRODUCT ITSELF)
                            - if product is not found in API return modal (no search results found)

    - Getting working buttons onto ingredients, buttons that are pushed will save into 
        their user route 
    - Getting working buttons on the user profile to delete saved products or saved ingredients.
    - Getting working buttons onto Products, buttons that are pushed will save into 
        their user route
