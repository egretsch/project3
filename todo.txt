to do -

Get Scanner to work with Product Search
--This means:
    - Save the scanned product code into a database WITH the brand name of product
        (this is so if the product is scanned again, there won't be a need to input the name again)
    - Getting the information from the database and putting it in the product search.

Get Database routes to work:
--This means:
    - Saving users into a database with information.
    - Getting user tokens to be throughout the website.

Get the information from the database onto their respective pages:
--This means:
    - Profile page should receive user information from the database.
    - Search page should see user saved ingredients and warn them appropriately on products with their ingredients

Let users update their information
--This means:
    - Getting working buttons onto ingredients, buttons that are pushed will save into 
        their user route (preferably ingredients route).
    - Getting working buttons on the user profile to delete saved products or saved ingredients.
    - Getting working buttons onto Products, buttons that are pushed will save into 
        their user route (preferably products route).
